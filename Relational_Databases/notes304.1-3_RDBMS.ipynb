    "- Some of the most commonly used constraints available in SQL include: \n",
    "    - NOT NULL Constraint − Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value.\n",
    "    - DEFAULT Constraint − Provides a default value for a column when none is specified.\n",
    "    - UNIQUE Constraint − Ensures that all values in a column are different.\n",
    "    - PRIMARY Key − Uniquely identifies each row/record in a database table.\n",
    "    - FOREIGN Key − Uniquely identifies a row/record in any of the given database tables.\n",
    "    - CHECK Constraint − Ensures that all of the values in a column satisfy certain conditions.\n",
    "    - INDEX − Used to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly.\n",

    "    - Group By - Groups a set of rows into a set of summary rows by values of columns and returns one row for each group.\n",
    "        - Often used w/ aggregate functions such as `SUM(), AVG(), MAX(), MIN(), COUNT()` etc. Behaves like DISTINCT when used w/out aggregate functions\n",
