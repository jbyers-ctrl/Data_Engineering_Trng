    "## Guided Lab 341.4.2 - Building a simple event management system\n",
    "### Learning Objective:\n",
    "By the end of this lab, learners will be able to use Date and Time series in python applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lab Objective:\n",
    "This lab focuses on utilizing Python's date and time functionalities to construct a basic event management system. Throughout this lab, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learn to manipulate dates and times in Python: You'll work with the datetime module to represent and manipulate dates and times, crucial for scheduling and managing events.\n",
    "- Build an event management system: You'll create a program that enables users to schedule events, providing the event name and date.\n",
    "- List and organize events: The system will allow users to view upcoming events, sorted chronologically, along with the number of days remaining until each event.\n",
    "- Implement user interaction: You'll design the program to interact with users, allowing them to add events, list events, and exit the program.\n",
    "### Lab Overview:\n",
    "Here's a real-world example of using Python's date and time functionality to build a simple event management system. In this example, we'll create a program that allows users to schedule and list events, and it will automatically remind them of upcoming events.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We will use a dictionary events to store event names as keys and their corresponding dates as values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Users can add events by providing a name and a date in the format \"YYYY-MM-DD.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- Users can list upcoming events, which are sorted by date and include the number of days remaining until each event.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The program continues running until the user chooses to quit."

    "- list_events() Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The list_events() function displays a list of upcoming events, sorted by date. It calculates the number of days remaining until each event and shows this information to the user. If there are no events, it informs the user that there are no upcoming events.\n",
    "\n",
    "- main() Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The main() function serves as the main entry point of the program. It presents a menu to the user with three options: adding an event, listing events, and quitting the program. It uses a while loop to repeatedly prompt the user for their choice until they choose to quit.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Running the Program:\n",
    "\n",
    "The if name == \"main\": condition ensures that the main() function is executed when the script is run. Users can add events, list events, or quit the program. The program will keep running until the user chooses to quit."
