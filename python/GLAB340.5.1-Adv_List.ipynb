    "- By the end of this lab, You will be able to utlize the list[] with functions.\n",

    "### lab Objective:\n",
    "The primary objective of this code is to create a function that combines two lists of years, recent_first and recent_last, and arranges the years in chronological order. The code aims to achieve the following objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reverse the order of the recent_first list to make it chronological.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extend the recent_last list by appending the reversed recent_first list to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Return the combined list, which is now in chronological order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide a clear example of how to call the function and print the combined list, demonstrating its practical usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "#### Example One: Using .reverse() and .extend methods\n",
    "- This following function accepts two variables, each containing a list of years. A current \"recent_first\" list contains [2022, 2018, 2011, 2006]. An older \"recent_last\" list contains [1989, 1992, 1997, 2001]. The lists need to be combined with the years in chronological order.\n",

    "- Combine two lists using the .extend() method."
