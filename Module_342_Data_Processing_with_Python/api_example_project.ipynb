    "#### Below is an example that uses an API from the show Rick and Morty [Rick and Morty API] to filter characters by species and status, then returns the minimum and maximum episode counts among those characters. The code is structured with comments and detailed error handling. Place the appropriate code wherever you see {UPDATE}in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Suggestions\n",
    "1. Function Purpose & Arguments The episodeCount function is designed to interact with the Rick and Morty API. It filters the characters by:\n",
    "    - Species: For example, \"Human\" or \"Alien\".\n",
    "    - Status: Such as \"Alive\", \"Dead\", or \"unknown\". Once filtered, it calculates the count of episodes each character appears in, ultimately returning the minimum and maximum episode counts among them.\n",
    "1. Pagination Handling The API returns paginated results. We start at page 1 and use a loop to process all pages:\n",
    "    - Each page is fetched using an HTTP GET request.\n",
    "    - The JSON response is parsed to extract the list of character records.\n",
    "    - The loop continues until there is no next page in the response's info field.\n",
    "1. Error Handling The try...except block ensures that any network errors or JSON parsing issues are caught. If an error occurs, an exception is raised with a descriptive message.\n",
    "1. Filtering & Data Extraction Inside the loop, each character is inspected:\n",
    "    - If both the species and status fields match the given parameters, the code counts the number of episodes (using the length of the episode list).\n",
    "    - The minimum and maximum episode counts are updated accordingly.\n",
    "1. Return Value After processing all pages:\n",
    "    - If no characters meet the criteria, [0, 0] is returned.\n",
    "    - Otherwise, the function returns a list of two integers representing the minimum and maximum episode counts of the filtered characters.\n"
