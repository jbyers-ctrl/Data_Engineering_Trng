    "## Real World Example - Get Products from RestAPI\n",
    "### Lab Objective:\n",
    "- In this lab, you will demonstrate how to use Rest API using Python. You will learn how to fetch products from an API endpoint, save the data to a JSON file, and search for specific products using the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Key Skills:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Using the requests module in Python to send HTTP requests. Sending requests to a REST API endpoint. Searching for products using API parameters. Saving API response data to a JSON file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learning Objective:\n",
    "- By the end of this lab, learners will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Use requests module in Python.\n",
    "    - Send request to REST API endpoint.\n",
    "    - Search products from REST API endpoint.\n",
    "    - Save data from REST API endpoint to Json file.\n",
    "- Lab Activities:\n",
    "    - *Fetching and Saving Product Data: *You will use the requests module to send a GET request to the https://dummyjson.com/products API endpoint. The response data, containing product information, will be saved into a JSON file named \"products_information.json\".\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Searching for Products: You will learn how to search for products using the API's search functionality. By modifying the API endpoint URL to include a search query (e.g., https://dummyjson.com/products/search?q=Oil), you can retrieve products related to a specific keyword. The results will be displayed in the Colab output.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The requests is Pre-installed: Google Colab environments come with many common Python libraries pre-installed, and requests is very frequently among them. So, in many cases, you can simply import and use it without needing to install it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you do need to upgrade requests, you can use either:\n",
    "\n",
    "- !pip install requests\n",
    "\n",
    "- %pip install requests\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example: Get all products and save them to Json file\n",
    "    - The endpoint Api is: https://dummyjson.com/products\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The following example use the requests module to sends an HTTP GET request to the https://dummyjson.com/products API endpoint. The response data, containing product information, will be saved into a JSON file named \"products_information.json\" with an indentation of 4 spaces."
